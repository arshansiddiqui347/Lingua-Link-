# LinguaLink Prototype 🤟

An AI-powered web application prototype for sign language recognition and translation, designed to bridge communication gaps and promote accessibility.

## 🌟 Vision

LinguaLink aims to become a real-time augmented reality (AR) application that translates sign language into spoken language and vice versa, creating seamless communication between deaf and hearing communities.

## 🚀 Current Prototype

This prototype demonstrates:
- Real-time webcam hand tracking using TensorFlow.js Handpose model
- Basic gesture recognition for common signs (👍, 👎, ✌️, 🤟, 👋)
- Simple translation display interface
- Responsive web design

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js, Handpose model
- **Computer Vision:** Real-time hand landmark detection
- **Design:** Responsive CSS with gradient backgrounds

## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lingua-link.git
   cd lingua-link
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
   - Or use a local server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Use the application:**
   - Click "Start Camera" to enable webcam access
   - Show one of the supported signs to the camera
   - Click "Recognize Sign" to see the translation

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Hand Detection:** Uses TensorFlow.js Handpose model to detect hands and extract 21 3D hand landmarks
2. **Gesture Recognition:** Analyzes landmark positions to identify specific signs (simplified in this prototype)
3. **Translation Mapping:** Maps recognized gestures to their meanings and displays translations

## 🌈 Supported Signs (Prototype)

- 👍 - Hello / Good
- 👎 - No / Bad
- ✌️ - Peace / Victory
- 🤟 - I Love You
- 👋 - Wave / Hello

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Train custom ML model for accurate sign language recognition
- [ ] Expand vocabulary to include ASL alphabet and common phrases
- [ ] Implement real-time continuous translation (without button click)
- [ ] Add AR integration for mobile devices
- [ ] Include speech-to-sign language conversion
- [ ] Add multiple sign language support (ASL, BSL, etc.)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Integration of AI/ML models in web applications
- Computer vision and hand tracking techniques
- Responsive web design and modern CSS
- Accessibility-focused development
